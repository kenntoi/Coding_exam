# Problem Sets and Solutions
##### This repository contains my solutions to three coding problems provided as part of the coding exam. 
## 1. Palindrome Pairs
### Problem Description:
##### Given a list of unique words, your task is to find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the list so that the concatenation of the two words, 
i.e., words[i] + words[j], forms a palindrome.
## 2. Valid Parentheses
### Problem Description:
##### Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is
valid. An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
## 3. Longest Increasing Subsequence
### Problem Description:
##### Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
## How to Run (python required)
#### 1. Double click the '.py' file in Windows Explorer to run it. Howecer, the terminal
window might close immediately after execution so its better to run it from the command prompt to see the output.
### Using Command Prompt
#### 
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where '.py' is located using cd command. example. 'cd path/to/palindrome.py
3. Run the file by typing Python LISlenght.py.
