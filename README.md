# Problem Sets and Solutions
##### This repository contains my solutions to three coding problems provided as part of the coding exam. 
## 1. Palindrome Pairs
### Problem Description:
##### Given a list of unique words, your task is to find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the list so that the concatenation of the two words, 
i.e., words[i] + words[j], forms a palindrome.
## 2. Valid Parentheses
### Problem Description:
##### Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is
valid. An input string is valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
## 3. Longest Increasing Subsequence
### Problem Description:
##### Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence
